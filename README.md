## Overview

![screenshot](src/assets/images/recipesApp.gif)

This app was built with the purpose to better my programming skills the app is about recipes I use [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to get all the recipes in the app you can filter recipes by categories, countries and ingredients.

My experience to develop this project was a fascinating at the beginning I didn't have any idea what will be the design for this app that was a challenge for me, but I got some inspiration using websites such as [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) also I had some obstacles on the way for instance the API didn't have pagination I had to research how to create a local pagination.

I learned a lot of things developing this app, for example I learned how to use lazy loading in angular.
